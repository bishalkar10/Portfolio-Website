                I'm an extremely ambitious and pasionate software engineer. I am
                proficient in developing responsive web application using HTML5,
                CSS3, Javascript, ReactJs, Sass, Tailwindcss. I have deployed my
                works on Github Pages and Netlify. I use vite.js, which is
                several times faster then the old and slow webpack. I am
                confident than I can take a design and convert it into a
                pixel-perfect web application. I can consume backend APIs using
                axios and integrate them in the Frontend side.
                <br /> <br />I am procient in version control using git and
                github, which make me able to work effectively in a team. I
                prefer Tailwindcss framework for styling web pages as it gives
                me the freedom with convinence to style responsive web pages. I
                have decent experience with SASS/SCSS too (this website is
                styled with SASS ðŸ˜‰). I familiar with Browser Developer Tools,
                which I use on a daily basis for debugging purposes. I have
                plenty of painful experienced debugging CSS. I am currently
                learning e2e testing using Playwright testing framework.
