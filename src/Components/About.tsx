                I'm an extremely ambitious and passionate software engineer. I
                am proficient in developing responsive web applications using
                HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, ReactJs, Sass, and Tailwind CSS. I have
                deployed my work on GitHub Pages and Netlify. I use vite.js,
                which is several times faster than the old and slow webpack. I
                am confident that I can take a design and convert it into a
                pixel-perfect web application. I can consume backend APIs using
                axios and integrate them in the Frontend side.
                <br /> <br />I am proficient in version control using Git and
                Git Hub, which makes me able to work effectively in a team. I
                prefer Tailwind CSS framework for styling web pages as it gives
                me the freedom with convenience to style responsive web pages. I
                have decent experience with SASS/SCSS too (this website is
                styled with SASS ðŸ˜‰). I familiar with Browser Developer Tools,
                which I use daily for debugging purposes. I have plenty of
                painful experience debugging CSS. I am currently learning e2e
                testing using the Playwright testing framework.
